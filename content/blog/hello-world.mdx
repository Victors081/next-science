## Welcome to Next Science

This is the inaugural post for Next Science, a platform that combines the power of **Next.js 16** with **Quarto** to create a modern, fast, and reproducible environment for data science content.

## What Makes This Special?

Unlike traditional blogging platforms, Next Science is built with data scientists and developers in mind:

- **Reproducible Analysis**: Use Quarto to run Python (and soon R) code that generates visualizations and metrics
- **Modern Stack**: Built on Next.js 16 with React Server Components for optimal performance
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support throughout the codebase
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark mode support for comfortable reading
- **Fast**: Static generation means pages load instantly

## How It Works

Content is written in **MDX** (Markdown + JSX), which allows you to mix narrative text with React components. For data experiments, you can write analysis code in **Quarto** documents that generate:

1. Summary statistics in JSON format
2. Visualizations as PNG/SVG files
3. Reproducible computational narratives

All of this is then seamlessly integrated into the Next.js build process.

## What's Next?
